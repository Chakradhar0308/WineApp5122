What is the problem you want to solve or the story you are trying to tell
The application explains the correlation between the components used in crafting different types of wine.
It gives insights into composition of different chemicals presnt in wine produced by 3 different framers from 3 different regions in Italy. You can play with the data and view different types of chart selecting different parameters and also can see boxplots avaerages and can draw conclusions.

Where did you get your data/How did you prepare your data?
Got the dataset which was readily available as an inbuilt dataset in streamlit.

Future work:
What if any future work do you plan to keep on doing to improve your app.
A lot can be improved, Being a new bee into streamlit, I could only implement basic charts and was not particularily into visual appeal, Induction of css and html code for visual appeal would be the next thing i would consider working. Implementing animations and making the application interactive is something I would like to work on going forward.
